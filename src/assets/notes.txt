How to create the validations in angular?
2 ways 

Template driven approch
-----------------------

we are handle the validatins in the template nothing but  .html file

View 
.ts file


Reactive approch
-----------------
we will take the reference of Form  into .ts file and do the action(work)



How you have to give the instruction to the angular weather that element (form ,div, texbox , p , button , span , h1)
is having below status
valid , invalid , pristine , dirty , touched , untouched


Angular Forms


touched 
untoched

valid   - touch and dirty but that value is not good(________@gmail.com)
invalid - touch and dirty but that value is not good( 123456)

pristine  -  element
dirty     -  

validation message

pristine --- form in the pristine status
